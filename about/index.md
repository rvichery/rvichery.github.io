About me

My name is RÃ©mi Vichery, and I am a 26 years old Network Engineer. I live in San Jose, California and I am currently working as a Technical Marketing Engineer for a SDN vendor. I graduated from ENSEEIHT in 2012 with a Master's degree in Computer Networking .

I am passionate about Software-Defined Data Center technologies and Software Engineering. I am involved in various open source projects, essentially developed in C and Python.

I spend my free time testing new technologies, playing guitar and running.
