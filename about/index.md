About me

My name is RÃ©mi Vichery, and I am a 25 years old Network Engineer. I live in Toulouse, France, and I am currently working as a Network & Virtualization Engineer for a French ISP. I graduated from ENSEEIHT in 2012 with a Master's degree in Computer Networking .

I am passionate about Software-Defined Data Center technologies and Software Engineering. I am involved in various open source projects, essentially developed in C and Python.

I spend my free time testing new technologies, playing guitar and running.
